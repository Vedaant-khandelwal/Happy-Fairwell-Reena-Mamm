                <p>You are indeed the best teacher in the world and I see it as a very big honor to have had the opportunity to be taught by someone like you. Adios,maâ€™am! I sincerely thank you for everything.

                    It is sad to say bye-bye to someone who is as awesome as you are, but the joyful thing is that your teachings will never depart from me. Thanks for being an incredible teacher.

                    I will miss all your wise sayings, guidance, counseling, and above all, your tutoring which has made school such a fun place to be. Goodbye, teacher.

                    Bidding farewell is the most difficult thing to say to the most amazing teacher on earth. We will surely miss you, but your teachings will forever reside in our hearts. Thank you, mamm!

                    You have taught me so many awesome things in this life and I shall forever be grateful to you for the impact you have made in my life. Bye-bye, teacher and once again thanks for everything.
